Abstration-->Hiding the implementation part
Abstraction can be achived in two ways---> Abstract class, Interface

Abstract class (mention abstract before class name to ensure thats a abstract class)
==============
1)It contains both abstract and non abstract methods
2)we need to use abstract as keyword to implement abstract methods
3)We need to use extends to keyword to implement abstract methods 
4)we cannot create object for both abstract and interface

Interface (interface is not class create interface)
=========
1)It contains only abstract methods
2)By default all are abstract here so we don't need to use keyword as abstract
3)To implement Interface we need to use implement keyword & we can achive multiple inheritance here

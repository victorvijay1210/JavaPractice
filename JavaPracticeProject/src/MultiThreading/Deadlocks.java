/*
  
 * Deadlocks (Thread Blocking Each Other)
 
A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting on each other indefinitely.

Avoid deadlocks by acquiring locks in a consistent order.

Summary
========
Deadlock happens when two or more threads hold resources and wait for each other to release them.

Fixed Locking Order â†’ Always acquire locks in the same order.

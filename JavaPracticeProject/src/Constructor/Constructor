What is a Constructor in Java?

A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type (not even void). Constructors are automatically called when an object is created.
Types of Constructors in Java
Default Constructor (No Arguments) 
Parameterized Constructor (Takes Arguments)
Constructor Overloading (Multiple constructors in the same class)
Copy Constructor (Creates a copy of another object)
